# summary

Generate incremental package manifest and source content

# description

Use two git commit reference to generate the package corresponding to what has changed in between

# examples

- Build incremental manifest from the previous commit

<%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %> --from "origin/development" --output-dir incremental

- Build incremental manifest and source from the development branch

<%= config.bin %> <%= command.id %> --from "origin/development" --generate-delta --output-dir incremental

# flags.deprecated

/!\ deprecated, use '--%s' instead.

# error.ParameterIsNotGitSHA

--%s is not a valid sha pointer: '%s' (If in CI/CD context, check the fetch depth is properly set)

# error.PathIsNotGit

'%s' is not a git repository

# warning.ApiVersionNotSupported

API version not found or not supported, using '%s' instead

# warning.FlowDeleted

Attempt to delete the flow '%s' via destructiveChanges.xml may not work as expected (see https://github.com/scolladon/sfdx-git-delta#handle-flow-deletion)

# warning.oldParameters

Using the '--%s' parameter is deprecated and will soon be obsolete. Use '--%s' parameter instead.
