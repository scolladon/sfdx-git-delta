# Contributing to SFDX-Git-Delta

We encourage the developer community to contribute to this repository. This guide has instructions to install, build, test and contribute to the framework.

- [Requirements](#requirements)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Testing](#testing)
- [Git Workflow](#git-workflow)

## Requirements

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/) >= 14
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) >= 1.22.5

## Installation

### 1) Download the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:scolladon/sfdx-git-delta.git
```

### 2) Install Dependencies

This will install all the tools needed to contribute

```bash
yarn
```

### 2) Build application

```bash
yarn pack
```

Rebuild every time you made a change in the source and you need to test locally

## Testing

### Unit Testing sgd

When developing, use [jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) unit testing to provide test coverage for new functionality. To run the jest tests use the following command from the root directory:

```bash
# just run test
yarn test

# run test with coverage details
yarn test:coverage
```

To execute a particular test, use the following command:

```bash
yarn test -- <path_to_test>
```

## Editor Configurations

Configuring your editor to use our lint and code style rules will make the code review process delightful!

### Code formatting

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is a code formatter used to ensure consistent formatting across your code base. To use Prettier with Visual Studio Code, install [this extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. The [.prettierignore](/.prettierignore) and [.prettierrc](/.prettierrc.json) files are provided as part of this repository to control the behavior of the Prettier formatter.

### Code linting

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a popular JavaScript linting tool used to identify stylistic errors and erroneous constructs. The [.eslintignore](/.eslintignore) file is provided as part of this repository to exclude specific files from the linting process.

### Commit linting

[Commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) is used to ensure commit respect our commit convention.
We follow the [angular](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/config-angular) commit convention.
Commit convention are enforced at pre-commit git hook using husky and at the pull request for each commit

You can use an interactive command line to help you create supported commit message

```bash
yarn commit
```

### PR linting

PR name is used to create the squash and merge commit message when the PR is validated.
Release creation is based on the commit convention in order to auto-generate the content and the type
It needs to follow our commit lint convention and it will be check at the PR level

## Git Workflow

The process of submitting a pull request is fairly straightforward and
generally follows the same pattern each time:

1. [Fork the sfdx-git-delta repo](#fork-the-sfdx-git-delta-repo)
1. [Create a feature branch](#create-a-feature-branch)
1. [Make your changes](#make-your-changes)
1. [Rebase](#rebase)
1. [Check your submission](#check-your-submission)
1. [Create a pull request](#create-a-pull-request)
1. [Update the pull request](#update-the-pull-request)

### Fork the sfdx-git-delta repo

[Fork][fork-a-repo] the [scolladon/sfdx-git-delta](https://github.com/scolladon/sfdx-git-delta) repo. Clone your fork in your local workspace and [configure][configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork] your remote repository settings.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR-USERNAME>/sfdx-git-delta.git
cd sfdx-git-delta
git remote add upstream git@github.com:scolladon/sfdx-git-delta.git
```

### Create a feature branch

```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout -b feature/<name-of-the-feature>
```

### Make your changes

Modify the files, build, test, lint and eventually commit your code using the following command:

```bash
git add <path/to/file/to/commit>
git commit ...
git push origin feature/<name-of-the-feature>
```

Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message

The above commands will commit the files into your feature branch. You can keep
pushing new changes into the same branch until you are ready to create a pull
request.

### Rebase

Sometimes your feature branch will get stale with respect to the master branch,
and it will require a rebase. The following steps can help:

```bash
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git checkout feature/<name-of-the-feature>
git rebase upstream/master
```

_note: If no conflicts arise, these commands will ensure that your changes are applied on top of the master branch. Any conflicts will have to be manually resolved._

### Check your submission

#### Lint your changes

```bash
yarn lint
```

The above command may display lint issues that are unrelated to your changes.
The recommended way to avoid lint issues is to [configure your
editor][eslint-integrations] to warn you in real time as you edit the file.

Fixing all existing lint issues is a tedious task so please pitch in by fixing
the ones related to the files you make changes to!

#### Run tests

Test your change by running the unit tests and integration tests. Instructions [here](#testing).

### Create a pull request

If you've never created a pull request before, follow [these
instructions][creating-a-pull-request]. Pull request samples can be found [here](https://github.com/salesforce/sfdx-git-delta/pulls)

### Update the pull request

```sh
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/${base_branch}

# If there were no merge conflicts in the rebase
git push origin ${feature_branch}

# If there was a merge conflict that was resolved
git push origin ${feature_branch} --force
```

_note: If more changes are needed as part of the pull request, just keep committing and pushing your feature branch as described above and the pull request will automatically update._
