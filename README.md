## What is SFDX-Git-Delta?

**SFDX-Git-Delta** (\*a.k.a. **SGD\***) helps Salesforce Architects and Developers accomplish 2 things with their source deployments:

1. **Make deployments faster**, by identifying the metadata that has been changed since a reference commit.
2. **Automate destructive deployments**, by listing the deleted (or renamed) metadata in a destructiveChanges.xml

To get a better understanding of what SGD is for, take a look at this post on the Salesforce Developers Blog: [Optimizing Unpackaged Deployments Using a Delta Generation Tool](https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2021/01/optimizing-unpackaged-deployments-using-a-delta-generation-tool.html).

## Is SGD for you?

If you are not a Salesforce Architect or Developer, probably not, _sorry_.

If you are a Technical Architect or Developer, then it‚Äôs a very useful tool for you, when the 3 conditions below are met:

    Your Salesforce project uses a git repo as the source of truth.
            ‚ûï
    You use the Source (DX) format in the repo.
            ‚ûï
    Your metadata is not packaged (in other words, your repo contains all the unmanaged metadata of the project).

SGD is designed to be part of a CI/CD pipeline (Jenkins, Bitbucket Pipelines, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps...) that handles the deployment of the sources to the Salesforce org(s).

Pro tips: If you are in the process of building your CI/CD pipeline, make sure you already have a fully functional pipeline **before** implementing delta deployments (otherwise it will just make it harder to debug your pipeline). It's also important to implement a bypass in your pipeline, to have the ability to fallback to full deployment in case the delta deployment is not behaving the way you expected it.

**DISCLAIMER:**

**‚ö†Ô∏è SFDX-Git-Delta is NOT an officially supported tool ‚ö†Ô∏è**

üë∑ Use it at your own risk, wear a helmet, and test it first before adding it to your pipeline üî•

## How to install it?

### Install as a Salesforce CLI plugin (sgd:source:delta):

SGD is a Salesforce CLI plugin (`sfdx sgd:source:delta`). Run the following command to install it:

```sh
sfdx plugins:install sfdx-git-delta
```

Because this plugin is not signed, you will get a warning saying that "This plugin is not digitally signed and its authenticity cannot be verified". This is expected, and you will have to answer `y` (yes) to proceed with the installation.

If you run your CI/CD jobs inside a Docker image, you can add the plugin to your image. Here is an example of a Dockerfile including the SGD plugin: https://github.com/mehdisfdc/sfdx-cli-gitlab

‚ö†Ô∏è The Salesforce CLI plugin is now the only supported way to install SGD. There used to be another way to install it directly through yarn or npm. The legacy `sgd` command is now deprecated and decommissioned.

### Prerequisites

Git command line is required on the system where the command line is running.

**Node v14.6.0 or above is required**.
To make sure that the Salesforce CLI is using the expected node version for SGD, run `sfdx --version` before attempting to install the SGD plugin: if you see a node version below v14.6.0 in the output, you'll need to fix it first.
If you encounter this issue while having installed the correct version of node on your system, try to [install the Salesforce CLI via npm](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_install_cli.htm#sfdx_setup_install_cli_npm) (`npm install sfdx-cli --global`) rather than with another installer.

### Important note for Windows users:

If you run SGD on a Windows system, make sure to use double quotes [to prevent the parameters from being interpreted by the terminal](https://github.com/scolladon/sfdx-git-delta/issues/134):

## Scenario:

Let‚Äôs take a look at the following scenario:

> **_The CI pipelines deploys the sources to Production anytime there is a new commit in the main branch._**

In our example, the latest commit to main is composed of:

- _Apex Class added:_ TriggerHandler
- _Apex Class added:_ TriggerHandler_Test
- _Apex Class modified:_ TestDataFactory
- _Apex Class deleted:_ AnotherTriggerFramework

![commit](/img/example_commit.png)

In this situation, we would expect the CI pipeline to:

1. **Deploy to Production only 3 classes** (no matter how much metadata is present in the force-app folder): `TriggerHandler`, `TriggerHandler_Test`, and `TestDataFactory`
2. **Delete from Production 1 class**: `AnotherTriggerFramework`

So let‚Äôs do it!

### Run the sgd command:

From the project repo folder, the CI pipeline will run the following command:

```sh
sfdx sgd:source:delta --to "HEAD" --from "HEAD^" --output .
```

which means:

> Analyze the difference between HEAD (latest commit) and HEAD^ (previous commit), and output the result in the current folder.

The `sfdx sgd:source:delta` command produces 2 usefull artifacts:

**1) A `package.xml` file, inside a `package` folder.** This `package.xml` file contains only the metadata that has been added and changed, and that needs to be deployed in the target org.

_Content of the `package.xml` file in our scenario:_
![package](/img/example_package.png)

**2) A `destructiveChanges.xml` file, inside a `destructiveChanges` folder.** This `destructiveChanges.xml` file contains only the metadata that has been removed or renamed, and that needs to be deleted from the target org. Note: the `destructiveChanges` folder also contains a minimal package.xml file because deploying destructive changes requires a package.xml (even an empty one) in the payload.

_Content of the `destructiveChanges.xml` file in our scenario:_
![destructiveChange](/img/example_destructiveChange.png)

In addition, we also could have generated a copy of the **force-app** folder with only the added and changed metadata, by using the `--generate-delta (-d)` option (more on that later).

### Deploy the delta metadata:

The simplest option to deploy the delta changes is to use `force:source:deploy`:
```sh
sfdx force:source:deploy -x package/package.xml --postdestructivechanges destructiveChanges/destructiveChanges.xml 
```

And voil√†! ü•≥

However, keep in mind that the above command will fail if the destructive change was meant to be executed before the deployment (i.e. as `--predestructivechanges`), or if a warning occurs. Make sure to handle those error scenarios in your CI/CD pipeline, so that you don't get stuck by a failed destructive change.

If needed, you can also separate the deploy of added/modified metadata and the destructive deployment, as in the below examples:

Use the `package/package.xml` file to deploy only the added/modified metadata:

```sh
echo "--- package.xml generated with added and modified metadata ---"
cat package/package.xml
echo
echo "---- Deploying added and modified metadata ----"
sfdx force:source:deploy -x package/package.xml
```

Use the `destructiveChanges` folder to deploy only the destructive changes:

```sh
echo "--- destructiveChanges.xml generated with deleted metadata ---"
cat destructiveChanges/destructiveChanges.xml
echo
echo "--- Deleting removed metadata ---"
sfdx force:mdapi:deploy -d destructiveChanges --ignorewarnings
```

### Diff between branches:

SGD works with any git sha pointer: commit sha, branch, tag, git expression (HEAD, etc.).

Here are 3 examples showing how you can compare the content of different branches:

**1) Comparing between commits in different branches**
For example, if you have commit `fbc3ade6` in branch `develop` and commit `61f235b1` in branch `main`:

```
sfdx sgd:source:delta --to fbc3ade6 --from 61f235b1 --output .
```

**2) Comparing branches (all changes)**
Comparing all changes between the `develop` branch and the `main` branch:

```
sfdx sgd:source:delta --to develop --from main --output .
```

**3) Comparing branches (from a common ancestor)**
Comparing changes performed in the `develop` branch since its common ancestor with the `main` branch (i.e. ignoring the changes performed in the `main` branch after `develop` was created):

```
sfdx sgd:source:delta --to develop --from $(git merge-base develop main) --output .
```

## Advanced use-cases:

### Generate a folder containing only the added/modified sources:

Using a package.xml file to deploy a subset of the metadata is probably the simplest approach to delta deployments. But there are some situations where you may want to have the actual source files related to all the components that have been changed recently.

One example is to speed up object deployments: the package.xml approach will result on the entire sub-folder for a given object to be deployed. On the opposite, having a copy of the actual sources added/modified allows you to chirurgically deploy only the modified components.

This is where the `--generate-delta (-d)` option comes handy!

Let's use this option with our previous example:

```sh
mkdir changed-sources
sfdx sgd:source:delta --to "HEAD" --from "HEAD^" --output changed-sources/ --generate-delta
```

In addition to the `package` and `destructiveChanges` folders, the `sfdx sgd:source:delta` command will also produce a copy of the added/changed files in the output folder.

_Content of the output folder when using the --generate-delta option, with the same scenario as above:_

![delta-source](/img/example_generateDelta.png)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è the `--generate-delta (-d)` can only be used when `--to (-t)` value is set to "HEAD" or to the "HEAD commit SHA".
> If you need to use it with `--to (-t)` pointing to another commit than "HEAD", just checkout that commit first and then use `--generate-delta (-d)`. Exemple:
>
> ```sh
> # move HEAD to past commit we are interested in
> $ git checkout <not-HEAD-commit-sha>
> # You can omit --to, it will take "HEAD" as default value
> $ sfdx sgd:source:delta --from "HEAD^" --output changed-sources/ --generate-delta
> ```

### Exclude some metadata only from destructiveChanges.xml:

The `--ignore [-i]` parameter allows you to specify an [ignore file](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) used to filter the
element on the diff to ignore. Every diff line matching the pattern from the ignore file specified in the `--ignore [-i]` will be ignored by SGD,
and will not be used to add member in `package.xml` nor `destructiveChanges.xml` (and will also be ignored when using the `--delta-generate` parameter).

But, sometimes you may need to have two different ignore policies for generating the `package.xml` and `destructiveChanges.xml` files. This is where the `--ignore-destructive [-D]` option comes handy!

Use the `--ignore-destructive` parameter to specify a dedicated ignore file to handle deletions (resulting in metadata listed in the `destructiveChanges.xml` output). In other words, this will override the `--ignore [-i]` parameter for deleted items.

For example, consider a repository containing multiple sub-folders (force-app/main, force-app/sample, etc) and a commit deleting the Custom\_\_c object from one folder and modifying the Custom\_\_c object from another folder. This event will be treated has a Modification and a Deletion. By default, the Custom\_\_c object would appear in the `package.xml` and in `destructiveChanges.xml`, which could be a little bit inconsistent and can break the CI/CD build. This is a situation where your may want to use the `--ignore-destructive [-D]` parameter! Add the Custom\_\_c object pattern in an ignore file and pass it in the CLI parameter:

```sh
# destructiveignore
*Custom\_\_c.object-meta.xml

$ sfdx sgd:source:delta --from commit --ignore-destructive destructiveignore

```

Note that in a situation where only the `--ignore [-i]` parameter is specified (and `--ignore-destructive [-D]` is not specified), then the plugin will ignore items matching `--ignore [-i]` parameter in all situations: Addition, Modification and Deletion.

### Explicitly including specific files for inclusion or destruction regardless of diff:

The `--include [-n]` parameter allows you to specify a file based on [micromatch glob matching](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch) used to explicitly include the specific files, regardless whether they have diffed or not. Similar to the `--ignore` flag, this file defines a list of glob file matchers to indicate which `git` aware files should always be included in the `package.xml` package. Every matching the pattern from the include file specified in the `--include [-n]` will be included by SGD.

As with `--ignore`, sometimes you may need to have two different include policies for generating the `package.xml` and `destructiveChanges.xml` files. This is where the `--include-destructive [-N]` option comes handy!

Use the `--include-destructive` parameter to specify a dedicated include file to handle deletions (resulting in metadata listed in the `destructiveChanges.xml` output). Here, you will indicate which files explicitly should be included in the `destructiveChanges.xml`.

For example, consider a repository containing multiple sub-folders (force-app/main,force-app/sample, etc) and the CI/CD platform generates a new file `force-app/generated/foo` that should not be included in the `source:deploy` command. You can create a file with a line matching this new file and specify this file using the `--include-destructive [-N]` parameter.

```sh
# destructiveinclude
*generated/foo

$ sfdx sgd:source:delta --from commit --include-destructive destructiveinclude

```

### Scoping delta generation to a specific folder

The `--source [-s]`parameter allows you to specify a folder to focus on, making any other folder ignored.
It means the delta generation will only focus on the dedicated folder.

For example, consider a repository containing multiple sub-folders (force-app/package, force-app/unpackaged, etc).
This repository contains sources deployed in a packaged (force-app/package folder) and sources deployed unpackaged (force-app/unpackaged)
You only want to apply delta generation for the unpackaged sources.

```sh
$ tree
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ force-app
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packaged
    ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ classes
    ‚îÇ        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PackagedClass.cls
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ unpackaged
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ classes
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ UnpackagedClass.cls
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...

# scope the delta generation only to the unpackaged folder
$ sfdx sgd:source:delta --from commit --source force-app/unpackaged
```

> The ignored patterns specified using `--ignore [-i]` and `--ignore-destructive [-D]` still apply.

### Generate a comma-separated list of the added and modified Apex classes:

Depending on your testing strategy, [you may be interested in generating a comma-separated list of the added and modified Apex classes](https://github.com/scolladon/sfdx-git-delta/issues/126) (to use in the `sfdx force:source:deploy --testlevel RunSpecifiedTests` command, for example).

To cover this requirement, you can use a tool such as [yq](https://github.com/kislyuk/yq) to parse the content of the package.xml file produced by SGD:

`xq . < package/package.xml | jq '.Package.types | if type=="array" then .[] else . end | select(.name=="ApexClass") | .members | join(",")'`

### Use the module in your own node application

If you want to embed sgd in your node application, install it has a dependency for your application

```sh
yarn add sfdx-git-delta
```

Then use the JavaScript module

```js
// sample/app.js
const sgd = require('sfdx-git-delta')

const work = await sgd({
  to: '', // commit sha to where the diff is done. [default : "HEAD"]
  from: '', // (required) commit sha from where the diff is done. [default : git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD]
  output: '', // source package specific output. [default : "./output"]
  apiVersion: '', // salesforce API version. [default : latest]
  repo: '', // git repository location. [default : "."]
})

console.log(JSON.stringify(work))
/* {
 *   config: config,
 *   diffs: { package: {...}, destructiveChanges: {...} },
 *   warnings: []
 * }
 */
```
